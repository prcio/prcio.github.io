I'm an engineer, physicist, and problem solver with a background in electrical and systems engineering, physics, and applied mathematics. I enjoy tackling complex problems across multiple domains, whether it's designing hardware, modeling physical systems, or optimizing software solutions. My interests span embedded systems, automation, computational physics, and R&D for next-generation technologies.

Beyond engineering, I have a deep appreciation for quantitative finance, statistics, and economics, always looking for ways to apply analytical thinking outside of traditional STEM fields. I also have experience with CAD, machining, and hands-on manufacturing, balancing theoretical knowledge with practical implementation.

I take a rigorous, first-principles approach to everything I work on, always aiming for efficiency, scalability, and long-term impact. Currently, I'm exploring opportunities in engineering R&D, embedded systems, and computational modeling, while also building projects that merge engineering, physics, and software.

Outside of technical work, I have a strong interest in writing, linguistics, and history, particularly how technology shapes societies over time. I'm always learning, whether it's refining my writing skills, improving my coding efficiency, or mastering a new field that piques my curiosity.
